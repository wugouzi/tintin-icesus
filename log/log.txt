Chelan pushes one of the bricks and reveals a hidden cave leading south!
Chelan [party]: or not
The party goes south to: This room is filled with rubble and debris.  The air is stale and rank. 
Toppled wooden timbers lie across the floor. The floor is full of muddy
silt, and water leaks into this area from the various tunnels. Occasionally
a rat runs across the floor.  The remaining timbers that hold the ceiling
in from caving in are rotting away, and it wouldn't take much to cause them
to fall.

The ground is covered with muddy water.
        The obvious exits are north, south and east.

The party goes south to: The sewer flows  through this room, filling the room with a vile stench.
The walls are lined with wooden timbers, which support the mud packed
walls. One of the supports is oddly covered with cobwebs and other debris.
Pieces of trash have collected at corners throughout the tunnel in small
piles, slowly getting eaten away by the steady current of the sewer.  A few
of the wooden timbers in the room have rotted away at the bottom, causing
them to fall diagonally across the sewer, leaning up against the far wall.

The party goes east to: The stench of the sewer is less here, as the water is moving more swiftly
in this larger tunnel. The construction of the tunnel has also changed, the
wooden timbers supporting the tunnels are gone, and the tunnel is now made
of stone.  There are a variety of little cracks and fissures among the
stone, where the water has started to erode the stone away.  Occasionally
you can hear the squeak of a rat echoing throughout the tunnel. The main
tunnel continues to east and west, and some water flows in from the smaller
southern tunnel.

The party goes southwest to: You find yourself walking in a tunnel with a roof which arches above your

The party goes up to: This is a manhole going down to the sewers of Vaerlon. The smell coming
from down is absolutely hideous, the idea of going down there feels
repulsive. This manhole has been dug into the stone and dirt by the skilled
dwarven miners, so the quality of the work is very good. Some light is
coming from upstairs, but it's completely dark down there. A steel ladder
goes up from this landing, and a wooden ladder leads down.

dark, and a lot of collapsed rock and stone lies in piles around this room;
looks like the ceiling has collapsed not so long ago. The floor is cup
shaped, on the edges it is dry, but in the middle of the room there is body
of water. In the middle of room is biggest pile of stone, it looks like a

with rotting sewage. Some of it has formed small pools which give off
unimaginable stench. There seem to be some kind of wooden supports that
crisscross the walls and the roof here.

The ground is covered with muddy water.
        The obvious exits are northeast and southwest.

The walls are lined with wooden timbers, which support the mud packed
walls.  Pieces of trash have collected at corners throughout the tunnel in
small piles, slowly getting eaten away by the steady current of the sewer. 
A few of the wooden timbers in the room have rotted away at the bottom,
causing them to fall diagonally across the sewer, leaning up against the

seems to be made of mud supported by wooden timbers.

wooden timbers supporting the tunnels are gone, and the tunnel is now made

stone, where the water has started to erode the stone away.  Occasionally
you can hear the squeak of a rat echoing throughout the tunnel. The main

The party goes east to: The sewer tunnel is massive in size. You estimate its width to be around 10
metres and the ceiling hangs a few meters above you. On both sides of the
tunnels are walkways, allowing relatively clean and, most importantly, dry
adventuring to southeast. Those going to northwest or west have to wade
through the sewage. Between the walkways putrid water flows almost
unnoticeably slow. Occasionally a few air-bubbles rise from the depths. The
walls and the arched ceiling is infested with moss and lichen, which have
transformed to a dubious colour and appearance. Breathing is quite arduous,
since the air is musky and tangy. Echo of water dripping from the ceiling
makes your nerves tense. Here the two main sewers merge as one, that flows
slowly towards the lake to southeast. A ladder goes up to a manhole.

The party goes northwest to: This is one of the primary passages, twenty meters across and contains
meter-wide railless walkway-ledges on both sides. The air is, for some
reason, reasonably good in this part of the tunnel. However, lots of noise
echoes from the water flow, and a terrible rotten stench still engulfs this
part of the tunnel. Water is flowing in from a small natural cave from
northeast.

knows who they are or why they are in the Nether Plane. Some say they are
the real rulers of this Plane, others say that the Gods put them here to
protect mortals from some unknown great evil which is hidden in the Nether
Plane. The Ethereal stands silent, looking at you, and its unseen gaze
fills you with the same unease as the sense of being constantly watched
which is always present in that plane.

It is an ethereal (undead) and somewhat large of size.
Chelan's ethereal is in excellent shape! (100%)

Wielded in right hand and left hand: staff of the ethereal guardian, formed of nether energies
It radiates raw power of earth.
It is surrounded by an aura of coldness of the netherplane.
The party goes southeast to: This room is filled with rubble and debris.  The air is stale and rank. 
Toppled wooden timbers lie across the floor. The floor is full of muddy
silt, and water leaks into this area from the various tunnels. Occasionally
a rat runs across the floor.  The remaining timbers that hold the ceiling
from caving in are rotting away, and it wouldn't take much to cause them to
fall.

The ground is covered with muddy water.
        The obvious exits are east and northwest.

The party goes east to: The water almost fills this small tunnel.  The water flows slowly through
this area, with patches of sewage gathering together in the small eddies. 
Barely above the top of the water you can see the tops of wooden timbers
holding up the ceiling of the sewer.  Water drips from the ceiling of the
tunnel.  The stench of the tunnel is overwhelming, and it is very hard to
breathe.

        The obvious exits are south, north and west.

The ethereals are mysterious beings that can be spotted occasionally
walking along the passages of the Nether Plane. The ethereal is completely
draped in a grey robe with its hood pulled up, hiding every feature of its
body. Even so, you can feel it looking at you from under the hood. No one
knows who they are or why they are in the Nether Plane. Some say they are
the real rulers of this Plane, others say that the Gods put them here to
protect mortals from some unknown great evil which is hidden in the Nether

It radiates raw power of earth.
It is surrounded by an aura of coldness of the netherplane.

The party goes south to: You are in a round chamber with slightly angled floor towards the center of
the chamber, where is a gaping black hole in the floor the putrid sewage
water from the three tunnels flow into with a loud gurgling. To get to the
other side of the chamber, there are walkways following the wall very
closely, so one has to circle the chamber to access into the other tunnel
entrances. The air is breathable here because of almost adequate
ventilation provided by the three winding sewer corridors.

The ground is covered with muddy water.
        The obvious exits are north, east and southwest.

The party goes east to: The sewer flows  through this room, filling the room with a vile stench.
The walls are lined with wooden timbers, which support the mud packed
walls.  Pieces of trash have collected at corners throughout the tunnel in
small piles, slowly getting eaten away by the steady current of the sewer. 
A few of the wooden timbers in the room have rotted away at the bottom,
causing them to fall diagonally across the sewer, leaning up against the
far wall.

The party goes east to: The stench of the sewer is less here, as the water is moving more swiftly
in this larger tunnel. The construction of the tunnel has also changed, the
wooden timbers supporting the tunnels are gone, and the tunnel is now made
of stone. There are a variety of little cracks and fissures among the
stone, where the water has started to erode the stone away. Occasionally
you can hear the squeak of a rat echoing throughout the tunnel.

The party goes southeast to: This is one of the primary passages, twenty meters across and contains
meter-wide railless walkway-ledges on both sides. The air is, for some
reason, reasonably good in this part of the tunnel. However, lots of noise
echoes from the water flow, and a terrible rotten stench still engulfs this
part of the tunnel. Water is flowing in from a small natural cave from
northeast.

The party goes northeast to: You are in a small natural looking cave. The walls are damp and covered
with slime. There is enough moisture in the air to make the floor very
slippery. There is a small waterfall at the east end of the cave. The water
flows to the sewers to southwest.

The ground is covered with muddy water.
        The only obvious exit is southwest.

There is a large table located near the north wall and it is covered with
old tomes, empty flasks, large jugs and some powder pouches. At the center
of the room there is also a large rack with chain shackles. A rapid
waterfall works as the western wall, and a small doorway leads to a chamber
to south. A stone staircase leads down. There are several strange orbs of
light hovering near the walls.

        The obvious exits are south, down and west.

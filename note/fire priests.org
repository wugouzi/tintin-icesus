* Throw
    You predict the next move of your opponent and accurately throw the black, clearly glowing spear

and DEVASTATING EVERYTHING in the weapon's path.
* Miscellaneous
** race
22:28:42 Zohlor tells you 'dex,str,wis,con is the order
of stats you want to go for'.
22:29:11 Zohlor tells you 'race is tricky, but antaeun
is kinda good and you get to join nomads'.
22:29:47 Zohlor tells you 'orc with devourer is good
too'.

22:33:58 Zohlor tells you 'basically you want to look at
the racial guilds and pick a specific race fit for them.
Nomads and devourer (slightly more) have perks that are
really beneficial for playing it more offensively,
civilized has perks (especially the preach perk) that
benefit the party a bit more but you won't be as good
with frontrowing stuff'.

Harac tells you

juxtaposed barrage is throw mastery, increases when you throw and as it rises it
adds those copythrows

lord of war is for blaze of glory which gives momentums to party, increases when ppl uses them i
think

sainthood mastery is the one that raises when you get yourself asskicked, very slow atlast for me :P

secrets of fire is somekind of overall mastery i think, also very slow

triuph over magic rises when you use mana scald to get opponents spellcast visible, sometimes it
even blocks spells so its very good one

undying faith has something to do with fury, raises when usin spells i think

devotion is the same

words is preaching mastery

world in flames is when you burn things like corpses, dunno if spells raises it too'.

Harac tells you 'and rapture is for spells/spellblade i think'.

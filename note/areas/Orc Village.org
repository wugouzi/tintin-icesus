#+title: Orc Village

You ask Itok about kruric.
Itok says: Kruric is a big bully! He gives some potion to adults every
evening, but I never get any!! And then the adults start running around and
fighting and hitting and bashing and jumping from the roofs just like uncle
Groggie did, and I haven't seen uncle Groggie after that.. Do you know
where uncle Groggie went?

You ask Itok about groggie.
Itok says: He is the best! He always tells these funny stories to kids!
